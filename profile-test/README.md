# Profile-Test

A React project built with Vite.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- @vitejs/plugin-react (Babel / oxc)
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc (SWC)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled by default due to performance impact.

## ESLint

For production apps, consider using TypeScript and type-aware lint rules.
